### PR Template
Please follow the template below when posting a Pull Request (PR) to apply changes on the main branch: 

> ### Title
> 
> **Corresponding Task:** *(link to notion task and/or task name & id)*
> 
> **Overview:** *(1-2 sentences detailing what is being implemented and/or changed)*
> 
> **QA Testing:**
> - *Include comprehensive steps on how to test the implementation (e.g., environment configuration, credentials, unit & integration testing)*
> - *(If possible) Include a GIF image and/or short 10-30 second video showing testing the implementation*
> 
> **Next Steps:** *(list the required next steps and/or considerations for future implementations)*

**Please consider the following points when posting a PR:**
- Reviewers should read each PR description thoroughly in order to test and understand the requested implementation.
- Each PR requires at least **2 approvals** in order to be merged into the main branch.
- Assign corresponding group members as reviewers to the PR (automatically notifies them for a faster review process)
- Assign the necessary labels (e.g., high/medium/low priority, bug, new feature, etc.)
- Each development task in Notion should correspond to **one** PR *(a PR should not include more than one task)*
- Leverage draft PRs to
